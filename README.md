## Goals
This is an intentionally vulnerable web application. There are 3 steps to complete the challenge, and multiple ways
to complete each step.

1. You must gain access to either user1, or user2's account
2. Next, gain access to the admin account
3. Finally, find a way to remotely execute arbitrary commands

I would suggest to try and find every way to get the most out of TUDO.

**And finally, good luck!**
